# Agriculture Climate & Yield Analytics Dashboard 

An end-to-end Data Analytics & Business Intelligence project built using AWS, Snowflake, and Power BI to analyze the impact of climate conditions on agricultural crop yields.

This project demonstrates how environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, and humidity influence agricultural production across different crops, seasons, and locations.

## Project Overview

Agriculture is highly dependent on climate patterns. This dashboard provides insights into:

🌧 Rainfall trends

🌡 Temperature variations

💧 Humidity levels

🌾 Crop yield performance

The goal is to help understand relationships between climate conditions and agricultural output using cloud data warehousing and interactive BI reporting.

## Tool	Purpose
AWS	Cloud data storage environment
Snowflake	Cloud Data Warehouse for structured data
Power BI Desktop	Data modeling & dashboard creation
Power BI Service	Cloud-based report publishing & sharing
DAX	Measures and calculated fields
## Architecture Flow

Data → AWS Storage → Snowflake Warehouse → Power BI → Power BI Service

Agricultural dataset stored in cloud environment

Data loaded into Snowflake for warehousing

Power BI connected to Snowflake

Data modeled using relationships and measures

Interactive dashboards built

Report published to Power BI Service
